                By utilizing highly skilled temporary individuals instead of permanent employees, the approach allows technologies and teams of varied sizes to scale up or down fast. An staff augmentation firm, such as Code Reflect, delivers highly qualified developers as external employees to other organizations. 
              </p>

              <p class="text-gray font-weight-500 margin-bottom-10">
                In contrast to in-house employees, augmented staff members often work remotely and on a contract basis. When client demand spikes or your company's workload increases, your team can rely on Code Reflect to provide the best talent.

                  At Code Reflect, the first thing we do is talk with your organization to determine your IT staffing needs, including the number of developers you need, the needed skills and certifications, and the expertise required. Ultimately, it's our responsibility to understand what your organization wants and then execute on it.
